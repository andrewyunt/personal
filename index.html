            <h1>Andrew Yunt</h1>
            <p>Software Engineer</p>
            <p>Hi my name is <strong>Andrew Yunt</strong>, and I'm a senior studying Computer Science at Iowa State University.</p>
            <p>I'm passionate about learning new technologies, brainstorming new ideas, and building creative solutions. During my time in college I have had four software engineering internships, in which I gained experience with Python, Golang, Kubernetes, and AWS.</p>
            <p>During my time in college I also co-founded an AI-based resume building startup which did not work out, but I learned many great lessons. I hope to found my own company again in the future when the time is right.</p>

                <h3>Resume Raise</h3>
                <p>One of the biggest projects I have created is the backend for my previous startup. The backend was written primarily in C#, but also had some components written in Python for natural language processing.
                    The project featured a resume building system that supported multiple templates, resume content sections, and allowed exporting resumes to both docx and pdf formats.
                    The resume builder also integrated with OpenAI and had a system for receiving automated resume feedback.
                    I spent over 6 months working on this project with another teammate, commiting code on a frequent basis.
